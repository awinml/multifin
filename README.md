# MultiFin: A Dataset for Multilingual Financial NLP

MultiFin is a publicly available financial dataset consisting of real-world article headlines covering 15 languages across different writing systems and language families. The dataset consists of a hierarchical label structure providing two classification tasks: multi-label and multi-class.

## Dataset Description

The MULTIFIN dataset is a multilingual corpus, consisting of real-world article headlines covering 15
languages. The corpus is annotated using hierarchical label structure, providing two classification tasks:
multi-class and multi-label classification.

- **Curated by:** Rasmus JÃ¸rgensen, Oliver Brandt, Mareike Hartmann, Xiang Dai, Christian Igel, and Desmond Elliott.
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English, Spanish, Polish, Hungarian, Greek, Danish, Turkish, Japanese, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian, Italian, Hebrew, Icelandic.
- **License:** [More Information Needed]

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of 10,048 headlines in 15 languages annotated with 23 topic labels for LOW-LEVEL and 6 HIGH-LEVEL topics for multi-class.

The dataset has been further stratified into two subsets:

1. **only_english**: that contains only English training data.
2. **high_resources:** a subset that contains 5 high-resource languages (i.e., English, Turkish, Danish, Spanish, Poland).

    abstract = "Financial information is generated and distributed across the world, resulting in a vast amount of domain-specific multilingual data. Multilingual models adapted to the financial domain would ease deployment when an organization needs to work with multiple languages on a regular basis. For the development and evaluation of such models, there is a need for multilingual financial language processing datasets. We describe MultiFin {--} a publicly available financial dataset consisting of real-world article headlines covering 15 languages across different writing systems and language families. The dataset consists of hierarchical label structure providing two classification tasks: multi-label and multi-class. We develop our annotation schema based on a real-world application and annotate our dataset using both {`}label by native-speaker{'} and {`}translate-then-label{'} approaches. The evaluation of several popular multilingual models, e.g., mBERT, XLM-R, and mT5, show that although decent accuracy can be achieved in high-resource languages, there is substantial room for improvement in low-resource languages.",
